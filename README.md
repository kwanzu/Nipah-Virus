# Nipah-Virus
Nipah virus is a zoonotic virus that can cause severe respiratory and neurological disease in pigs and humans. It was first discovered in Malaysia in 1999, where it spread from fruit bats to pigs and then to people who had contact with infected pigs. Since then, outbreaks have occurred almost annually in Bangladesh and India, where human infections are mostly linked to consumption of contaminated fruits or direct contact with infected bats. There is no vaccine or specific treatment for Nipah virus infection, and the case fatality rate can range from 40% to 75%.
